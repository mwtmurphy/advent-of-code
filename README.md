# Advent of Code 2019
 
Submissions for Advent of Code.

## Getting Started

Ensure that you've signed up to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Prerequisites

The 2019 sub-directory requires:

* [Python3.7 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The 2021 sub-directory requires:

* [Python3.9 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

All data for this repository can be found via [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Each participant receives different input data so the data you see in the repository is specific to me.

## Solutions

All the code I've used to created to solve the questions can be found in the respective years. For `2019`, I condensed these all into one file which can be found in `models`. For `2021`, I've approached it more loosely, where each day's code can be found in a respectively named notebook.
